The data already contains text and image features extracted from Sentence-Transformers and CNN.  

## How to run
1. Put your downloaded data (e.g. `baby`) under `data` dir.
2. Enter `src` folder and run with  
`python main.py -m TEMOO -d baby`  
You may specify other parameters in CMD or config with `configs/model/*.yaml` and `configs/dataset/*.yaml`.
